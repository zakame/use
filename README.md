# Zak Elep

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Zak B. Elep, aka [zakame](http://zakame.net).  I'm a recovering
sysadmin, having switched places to do web development (and more
recently, herding cats.) I like to think that I'm a journeyman Perl
hacker with a few o{l,o}d bits committed in the CPAN that I should be
busy updating myself, but thankfully because they're open source, a few
folks elsewhere are helping out on that end...

## What hardware do you use?

I'm a fan of [ThinkPads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad): my
current workhorses are an X200 and an X61 (both second-hand units,) and
there are a few dead T61s I have collected at home (my new work will
also hopefully let me have a new ThinkPad to use.)  I also have a more
modern ASUS 1215B netbook that I use mainly for gaming, and a Raspberry
Pi (connected to a cheap 23" LED TV) for some odd hacks.

I'm also a fan of old IBM [Model M
keyboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_Keyboard): my first one
is the classic 1391401 from April 1987, which is my main keyboard at
home.  Later, at the start of 2013, I got a 1391472 Space-Saving
Keyboard from Jun 1987 which I bring to work.  I also just received my
Feb 1998 13H6705 Model M13 Keyboard (the only black Model M with a
TrackPoint pointing stick) to use for work, keeping the SSK as a mobile
replacement; all of them are bought from eBay.

At my work, I am assigned a ThinkPad T420 with HD+ screen and a 128G
SSD, and a ViewSonic monitor to go with it.  I've brought my M13 to use
as my main keyboard.  So far, so good :-)

For mobile devices, I now have a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 7 2013, along with
my old HTC Desire as a standby (still carrying my main number.)  I also
have an LTE mobile hotspot that I switch connections with the Nexus 5
weekly to ensure fast connectivity almost all the time.

## And what software?

I mainly run Linux, in particular
[Slackware](http://www.slackware.com); all my machines run either the
latest stable (Slackware64-14.0) or the development
(Slackware64-current) update.  Early on I've been using Debian and
Ubuntu, but has since then moved to Slackware as I found it to be just
right for me.  I still run Windows though for some games I play (I've
been going back to my Steam archive recently and marching virtual armies
on Rome: Total War and Company of Heroes.)

For editing, I prefer [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs); I also use
that for reading Usenet, via Gnus.  I'm currently getting by with
Org-Mode (though I feel I still need to learn more about it,) and to
support Perl programming I use my own fork of 叶文彬's
[Emacs::PDE](https://github.com/zakame/emacs-pde).  When on remote
machines though, I use either plain vi or nano, whichever is available.

Being a Perl programmer, I tend to have a local copy of the CPAN on my
machines, thanks to the wonder that is Ricardo SIGNES'
[CPAN::Mini](http://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Mini), a local build of
various Perl versions, made possible with 劉康民's
[perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl), and Tatsuhiko Miyagawa's
[Carton](http://metacpan.org/module/Carton) to manage modules in
deployment environments.  Slackware (which I also mirror locally,
because it is just big enough ;) provides the rest of the development
toolchain, especially in -current, where the latest versions of gcc,
git, and various libraries are already available and just plain work.

## What would be your dream setup?

Part of my dream setup is already real (classic ThinkPads + clicky
keyboards + a Linux that just works.)  Can't hurt to want some minor
updates though, like maybe 64+ core CPU and a cool (temperature-wise)
discrete graphics multicores on a larger-resolution ThinkPad.)  In the
near future, I'll probably get extra RAM for the work machine (mainly
for more Docker containers,) and maybe an SSD or two to replace the HDDS
on my machines for a quick boost, though I'm waiting on both SSD
materials technology and Linux support to get better.
