# Zak Elep

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Zak B. Elep, aka [zakame](http://zakame.net).  I'm a recovering
sysadmin, having switched places to do web development (and more
recently, herding cats.) I like to think that I'm a journeyman Perl
hacker with a few o{l,o}d bits committed in the CPAN that I should be
busy updating myself, but thankfully because they're open source, a few
folks elsewhere are helping out on that end...

## What hardware do you use?

I'm a fan of [ThinkPads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad): my
current workhorse is an X220, and previously were X200 and X61, all
second-hand units, as well as a few dead T61s I have collected at home.
I also have T420 for use @$WORK (more on that below,) and also used to
have an ASUS 1215B netbook (previously for gaming on the go, but now
given to my folks for their own computing needs.)  There's also that
Raspberry Pi connected to a cheap 23" LED TV for some odd hacks in
between.

I'm also a fan of old IBM
[Model M keyboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_Keyboard): my
first one is the classic 1391401 from April 1987, which is my main
keyboard at home.  Later, at the start of 2013, I got a 1391472
Space-Saving Keyboard from Jun 1987 which I bring to work.  I also have
a 13H6705 Model M13 Keyboard (from Feb 1998, the only black Model M with
a TrackPoint pointing stick) to use for work, keeping the SSK as a
mobile replacement; all of them are bought from eBay.

At my work, I am assigned a ThinkPad T420 with HD+ screen and a 128G
SSD, and a ViewSonic monitor to go with it.  I've brought my SSK to use
as my main keyboard, with the M13 swapping in occasionally.  So far, so
good :-)

For mobile devices, I now have a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 7 2013, along with
my old HTC Desire as a standby (still carrying my main number.)  I also
have an LTE mobile hotspot that I switch connections with the Nexus 5
weekly to ensure fast connectivity almost all the time.

## And what software?

I mainly run Linux, in particular [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com);
all my machines run either the latest stable (Slackware64-14.0) or the
development (Slackware64-current) update.  Early on I've been using
Debian and Ubuntu, but has since then moved to Slackware as I found it
to be just right for me.  I still run Windows though for some games I
play (I've been going back to my Steam archive and marching virtual
armies on Rome: Total War and Company of Heroes.)

For editing, I prefer [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs); I also use
that for reading Usenet, via Gnus.  I'm currently getting by with
Org-Mode (though I feel I still need to learn more about it,) and to
support Perl programming I use my own fork of 叶文彬's
[Emacs::PDE](https://github.com/zakame/emacs-pde).  When on remote
machines though, I use either plain vi or nano, whichever is available.

Being a Perl programmer, I tend to have a local copy of the CPAN on my
machines, thanks to the wonder that is Ricardo SIGNES'
[CPAN::Mini](http://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Mini), a local build of
various Perl versions, made possible with 劉康民's
[perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl), and Tatsuhiko Miyagawa's
[Carton](http://metacpan.org/module/Carton) to manage modules in
deployment environments.  Slackware (which I also mirror locally,
because it is just big enough ;) provides the rest of the development
toolchain, especially in -current, where the latest versions of gcc,
git, and various libraries are already available and just plain work.

## What would be your dream setup?

Part of my dream setup is already real (classic ThinkPads + clicky
keyboards + a Linux that just works.)  Can't hurt to want some minor
updates though, like maybe 64+ core CPU and a cool (temperature-wise)
discrete graphics multicores on a larger-resolution ThinkPad.)  In the
near future, I'll probably get extra RAM for the work machine (mainly
for more Docker containers,) and maybe an SSD or two to replace the HDDS
on my machines for a quick boost, though I'm waiting on both SSD
materials technology and Linux support to get better.
